<h1>Start blogging</h1>

<p><em>Written by Roman Indermühle</em></p>

<p><em>April 26, 2023</em></p>

<p>Recently, I had the idea of starting my blog. Firstly, I wasn’t confident if I should do, but then I thought why not let’s try something new. Occasionally, you need to escape your comfort zone to create something new you never did before. Initially, I had no idea about what I should write. But if this is what really want to do, then in due time you will be flooded with amazing ideas.</p>

<h2>What is my blog about?</h2>

<p>In this blog, I don’t write about just one topic. I would like to share things with you what comes to my mind. But mainly it would be about technology, iOS development, Apple, my current projects and life. </p>

<h2>Stop saying tomorrow!</h2>

<p>If someone had told me, I should start with my blog. I would have answered maybe, but not yet because my writing skills are not good enough, especially in english. You can always find something why it’s not possible. You have to ask yourself what could be the benefits from it. As long as you haven’t tried out, you don’t know if you like this or not. </p>

<p>Lately, I learned how essential it is to leave our comfort zone to grow. Because when we don’t leave the safe zone, we can’t fail. Remain in the safe zone is the reason we don’t grow. Failure is part of our life, it’s not bad to fail. As Steve Jobs said once:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“If you’re afraid of failing, you won’t get very far.”  Steve Jobs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m on the same page with Steve. </p>

<p>Try as much as possible in your life, even if it’s not the right thing. Then start something new, possibly this fits better to you. There is no “I can&#39;t do this”, you will always find something you&#39;re good at it. Steve has an appropriate quote here as well:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.”  Steve Jobs </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this quote expresses very well what life is about. Just do what you love to do, the life is too short to something what you don’t like. Steve Jobs is a very inspiring person to me. Unfortunately, he has already passed away. </p>

<h2>Just do it</h2>

<p>When you&#39;re currently considering starting your blog. Then is my recommendation, just do it, don’t think too long about it. </p>

<p>Before I thought it’s much harder to write a blog, but actually, it isn’t very complicated. I use the program Ulysses for writing my blog. I highly recommend trying Ulysses out because it’s a compelling writing app for Mac, iPad, and iPhone. Ulysses isn’t like MS Word, it works more like a markup editor. The big advantage is that they reduced the user interface to the essential that you really can focus on writing content. </p>

<p>There are just four steps you need to do to start your own unique blog:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Start writing in Ulysses </li>
	<li>Select a style you like and export it to an HTML file</li>
	<li>Put it in a folder and push this to GitHub</li>
	<li>Then setup GitHub pages that it is reachable through a link. </li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it. Now you&#39;re ready to go. </p>

<p>I would love to hear what you think about my blog. Then please don’t hesitate and contact me over this mail link underneath. </p>
